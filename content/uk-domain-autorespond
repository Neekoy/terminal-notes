In order to register a .uk domain name, you need to be the owner of the corresponding .co.uk domain. Can you please confirm if you are the owner of conley.co.uk since if that isn't the case, we won't be able to process the registration for you and will need to issue a refund for the purchase.

If you are the owner of conley.co.uk, please provide us with the exact registrant information that you used in order to register the corresponding .co.uk domain, and I will process the registration for you.

Please let me know if you have any questions too.
