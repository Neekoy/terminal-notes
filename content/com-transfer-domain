In order to transfer the .com domain name you will need to contact the current registrar and obtain the EPP (transfer) code for it. Once you have it, you can log into your client area with us on my.vidahost.com and initiate the transfer through My Domains > Domain Transfer Centre > New Transfer.

Once you do this, you will receive an email on the administrative contact email where you will need to approve the transfer and enter the EPP code. Once you do this, you will just need to wait for up to 10 days for the domain name registry to manually approve the transfer, and there are no further actions required on your end during that phase.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
