1. Change your passwords to random, non-dictionary, 10+ character long ones. This leaves out breaking through by making pseudo-random guesses pretty much impossible.

2. Scan all devices where you are accessing the website or admin area for viruses. A single key-logger can breach any password if it's active when you type it.

3. Update all your content since all updates also include security fixes. Of course the hackers are usually one step ahead which is why the fixes are being implemented, however not staying behind the curve on updates will definitely help in that matter.

4. Make sure that you are using CMS/Plugins/Modules only from established developers. Big companies have an easier time staying on top of updates, and have (more) resources to allocate for pentesting.

5. Disable any content you aren't using. Any plugin, module, script that you aren't using is still a potential backdoor to your website and they are best removed completely.
