I believe a bit of clarification would be appropriate in this situation. We as a hosting company provide you with excellent servers where you can host your content. If the content itself is prone to exploits and is utilising plugins or applications that have holes that hackers can exploit - there is nothing we can do on our end to prevent this. We can, as we always do, provide you with advise and help you in the situation, however this help should not be considered a substitution for what a developer with experience with malware can provide. If any complaint is to arise, it would be most appropriately directed to the developer and his choice of software and plugins, rather than us since we only provide you with the hosting where you can upload the files.

It might seem like we are far more involved since we always go beyond what a regular hosting company would do, however please do not consider this our responsibility. We do this for the desire to help our customers as much as we can.

As of the moment - since this is a reoccurring issue, my advise would be to contact a developer with experience with malware who will make sure that your website is utilising only unexploitable/hard-to-exploit code.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.
