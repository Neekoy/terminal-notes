I sent the approver message to the administrative email account for the domain, which is admin@ or hostmaster@. If you don't have either one, you will need to create it, since the message is from the automated system and cannot be sent to another account.

Once you receive it, please approve the SSL which will trigger a second message containing the SSL certificate itself in a .zip file. Please attach that file to this conversation so I can install it for you onto the server.

Please let me know if you have any questions too.
