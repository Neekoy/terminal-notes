Can you please clear the email application and device's cache since they might be disrupting the functionality.

In order to clear the application cache you need to go through the following steps:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Proceed to Applications.
3. Select Manage Applications.
4. Tap the All tab.
5. Choose the name of the app in question.
6. From there, you will see the Clear cache and Clear data buttons.

You can also clear the device's cache partition if the above doesn't go through:

1. Turn the device off.
2. Press and hold the Power, Volume Up and Home buttons simultaneously.
3. When the phone vibrates, release the Power button but continue to press and hold the Volume Up and Home buttons.
4. Now, when Android recovery screen appears, highlight the wipe cache partition option using Volume Down button.
5. To confirm the selection, press the Power button.
6. Wait for a while until wiping the cache partition is finished.
7. Now, “Reboot System now” will appear on the screen. To highlight the option use the Volume Up/Down key.
8. Press the power button to confirm it, and your device will automatically reboot.

If the issue only persists when connected through mobile data, you can make sure that data sync is enabled at the following location:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Tap Data Usage.
3. Tap Menu icon.
4. Put a check mark on Auto Sync Data option.

If the above doesn't work, my advise would be to give a different email application a try and recreate it with the settings you outlined previously. Personally I'm using TypeMail and I haven't experienced any issues with it for IMAP.
