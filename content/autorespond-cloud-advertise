The Cloud platform is basically numerous synchronised hosting servers that operate behind a load balancer. For comparison - each cPanel server by design is a single server. This gives the advantage of stability for the Cloud platform and also the available resources allow us to have higher limitations which results in a better performance for the vast majority of websites.

The only downside is that the Cloud's interface (albeit extremely user-friendly) is different from the one on cPanel and for that reason it might feel different at the beginning.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or queries.
