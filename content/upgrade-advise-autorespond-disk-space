Your server shimmerwalls.servers.prgn.misp.co.uk came up on our monitoring system as running out of disk space and there doesn't seem to be anything that can be removed at this point. It's filled up naturally by files that you most likely need.

Can you please confirm if you can remove some of the content off of it, or alternatively we can upgrade the disk space on it. One way to upgrade would be to up only the disk space by 10GB for an additional Â£10 per month. Alternatively, we can upgrade the whole package, and you can preview the VDS20's specifications at the following URL on our website:

Please treat this request as urgent, since completely running out of disk space might/will result in issues with some of the services.

Please let me know if you have any questions too.
