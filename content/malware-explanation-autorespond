Generally there are two ways a breach might occur - first is if someone has your password. This usually happens when someone uploads a keylogger virus to your computer and then the application sends them your input information from which they get the usernames and passwords. It would be best if you run a scan for viruses on all devices which you are using for access.

The second way would be through an outdated or insecurely developed application. My advise would be to make sure that you are only using CMSs/Plugins/Modules only from established developers and keep them updated at all time, since every update also includes security fixes.
