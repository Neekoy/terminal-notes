Can you please provide me with the following information for the order, and we will proceed with the VPS setup for you:

Hostname: (This will be in the format of yourdomain.servers.prgn.misp.co.uk, where you can change 'yourdomain' to anything you would like to - your company name, domain name, etc.)

Primary Domain: (This would be the domain name that you would like to have as the main account on the server. It can be changed at a later point if you would like to)

Operating System: (Windows/Linux, and if you would like a particular distribution of Linux. By default we install CentOS which is the industry standard)

PHP Version:

MySQL Version:

Additional Software: (This would be any additional applications that you would like to have installed for the server. Even if you don't have any at the moment, we can always install at a later point by your request).

If you don't have any specific requirements, you can just confirm the domain name you want as the main domain - we can set up everything else as the default setup.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
