Thank you for the information. I sent the approver message for the SSL certificate to the administrative email accounts admin@peacocks.co.uk and hostmaster@peacocks.co.uk. If you don't have those email accounts set up, please create them and let me know so I can resend the message.

Once you receive the message, you will need to follow the link in it, and approve the SSL. This will trigger a second message which will contain a .zip file with the SSL certificate files. Please attach that file to this conversation so I can install the SSL onto the server for you.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions too.
